        <h1>What does he want to do?</h1>
        <p id="homeTEXT">Max has many dreams, but the one he has been working toward
            for a while is becoming a professional Video Game Developer and creating his own games. Companies
            like Riot Games and Atlus look really appealing, so you could say that 
            working at either of said companies would be his dream, while he works on his own
            projects on the side.

    <h1>Theres more!</h1>
    <p id="homeTEXT">In 2016, Max tried his hand at coding his first major game on
        Scratch: Splatoon ~ 2 Player! At the time, it was his pride and joy. Looking
        back at it now, he just laughs. Over the years, his games have increased in quality, with
        one game standing out in particular. Splatoon 2 ~ 2 Player is his current most popular game
        having over 15k views. This game is something that he has been improving slowly for years, 
        and is one of his proudest creations. 
        Check it out below, along with his other projects on <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/jane301/">Scratch</a> and his <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BluInkling">GitHub!</a>
